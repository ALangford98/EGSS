# State

**This is the only doc in the repo that is allowed to go stale, and it is kept
short so that fixing it is cheap.** Everything else — `docs/ENGINE.md`, the
trap list, the changelog — describes things that stay true once written. This
file describes where the work is *this week*, which does not.

It exists because the alternative was worse. `docs/HANDOVER.md` used to open
with a "Current state" section naming the commit `main` sat at, and it drifted
22 commits and one abandoned workflow behind reality. A session that read it —
as `CLAUDE.md` told it to, at a cost of about 53k tokens — came away with a
*confidently wrong* answer to "what are we working on", while `git log`, which
costs about 200 tokens and cannot drift, sat unread. **The expensive source was
the least current one.** So the volatile part was cut down to this page.

## Read this first, and read it with `git log`

```sh
git log --oneline -15
git status --short
git branch --show-current
```

**Where those disagree with this file, they win.** The owner commits their own
work between sessions and sometimes while a reply is being written, so any git
state you did not just observe is stale — including the branch name below.

## Where the work is

**Branch: `main`.** The owner asked to stay on it directly for the docs work;
`density-in-double` merged in `cf266b8` and is finished with.

The live area is **`TestEnv/src/TerrainLab.h`** (~11k lines) and the headers
around it — `Critters.h`, `Vegetation.h`, `Rocks.h`, `Climate.h`. It is a
first-person terrain demo that grew a felling-and-building game: you cut trees,
buck them into logs, rive planks, and raise structures out of a grid-snapped
kit of boards, logs and stone.

Last landed, newest first:

- **Chunk meshes merge into fixed 3x3x3 groups.** TerrainLab's terrain draws
  93 chunks as 9 groups in the default view (27 at most). Verified
  byte-identical before/after captures plus a self-test editing exactly on a
  group seam. See the changelog, 2026-09-04. `VoxelPlanet.h`'s 963 chunks are
  the harder half of the same roadmap item and still need it.
- **The context pipeline.** This file, a generated trap index
  (`./egss.py traps`, `--check` to detect drift), and a tiered read ladder in
  `CLAUDE.md`. Answering "what are we working on" cold went from ~252k tokens
  and wrong to ~3.9k and right.
- **Instancing.** Panels and animals batched: 764 draw calls → 33, submission
  1420 µs → 66 µs. Verified by rendering both ways and comparing pixels —
  byte-identical, 3,686,400 of 3,686,400 samples. Frame time did not move,
  because 16.667 ms is vsync.
- **`./egss.py prune`.** The checkout was 9.7 GB against 1.2 MB of source.
  Now 1.7 GB.
- **Life.** Boids, an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck lek swarm, active Brownian beetles —
  each checked against a formula `Critters.h` does not evaluate.

## What is next

Nothing is in flight. Unstarted, in the order they were last discussed:

- **Character attributes.** `s_Strength` in `TerrainLab.h` is deliberately a
  constant with a hook where a stat should be — carry capacity trained by use.
  The owner deferred this ("further down the line"), so **ask before starting
  it**.
- **Merge or LOD the chunk meshes, on the planet.** The TerrainLab half is
  done (above); `VoxelPlanet.h` still draws one call per chunk. Harder there —
  chunks stream and already carry a stride-based LOD, so the merge has to
  respect both. See `README.md` "Still outstanding".

## When this file is wrong

Fix it in the same commit as the work that made it wrong. It is one page on
purpose: if updating it feels like a chore, it has grown too big, and the
subsystem table in `docs/HANDOVER.md` is where durable facts belong instead.
